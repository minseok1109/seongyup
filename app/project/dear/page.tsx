          The question, 'Are you really good or poor at online reading?' serves
          as the cornerstone of this project. Given the diverse learning
          environments today, many learners struggle to accurately assess their
          own abilities, particularly in the context of reading for learning,
          which involves a complex cognitive process. Students often display a
          tendency to either overestimate or underestimate their reading skills.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-8">
          This discrepancy in self-assessment can hinder students from investing
          the appropriate effort and motivation into their learning or lead them
          to undervalue the texts they are meant to learn from. It is also
          plausible to hypothesize that this discrepancy ultimately contributes
          to failures and learning deficiencies.
        </p>
        <p className="indent-8">
          Therefore, this project aims to uncover the relationship between
          self-efficacy and reading competence by profiling, identifying the
          factors that influence it. Our ultimate goal is to develop tailored
          interventions and treatments for individuals based on their unique
          profiles.
