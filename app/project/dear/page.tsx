        The question, 'Are you really good or poor at online reading?' serves as
        the cornerstone of this project. Given the diverse learning environments
        today, many learners struggle to accurately assess their own abilities,
        particularly in the context of reading for learning, which involves a
        complex cognitive process. Students often display a tendency to either
        overestimate or underestimate their reading skills.
      </p>
      <p className="indent-8">
        This discrepancy in self-assessment can hinder students from investing
        the appropriate effort and motivation into their learning or lead them
        to undervalue the texts they are meant to learn from. It is also
        plausible to hypothesize that this discrepancy ultimately contributes to
        failures and learning deficiencies.
      </p>
      <p className="indent-8">
        Therefore, this project aims to uncover the relationship between
        self-efficacy and reading competence by profiling, identifying the
        factors that influence it. Our ultimate goal is to develop tailored
        interventions and treatments for individuals based on their unique
        profiles.
